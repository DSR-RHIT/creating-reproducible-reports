Welcome! The goal of the workshop is to introduce the R novice to reproducible research in the context of creating a reproducible report using R, RStudio, and knitr.  



### getting started

The pre-workshop homework should take about 30 minutes. 

- [learning objectives](pages/101_objectives.html)
- [pre-workshop homework](pages/102_pre-hw.html) 

The day of the workshop:  

- [workshop agenda](pages/103_agenda.html) 
- surveying the reproducible research ecosystem 
- considering a sample report 



### tutorials 

From launching a project to developing a basic report

- [organize your files](pages/104_organize-files.html)
- [start your first script](pages/105_first-script.html)
- [explore the data](pages/109_explore-data.html)
- [tidy the data](pages/110_tidy-data.html)
- [create the calibration graph](pages/111_graph.html)
- [perform a linear regression](pages/112_regression.html) 
- [write the client report](pages/113_report.html) 



### next steps 

- what to do when the data change
