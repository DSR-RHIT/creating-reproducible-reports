### create an R markdown script 

In your workshop main directory, 

- Launch your *rr-workshop.Rproj* 
- File --> New File --> R Markdown 
- Output Format -> HTML 
- Save As --> to the `scripts/` directory, using the filename  `009_tidying-wide-data.Rmd` 

The Rmd file is pre-populated with prose and some markdown syntax. Edit the meta-data header as shown:

```
---
title: Load-cell calibration --- examine wide data
author: your name
date: 2016-08-24
output: html_document
---
```



### render the script 

To *knit* the Rmd file and create the output document, 

- Save the file 
- ![knit html icon](../resources/images/knit-html-icon.png) 

The report should appear in the RStudio *Viewer* pane. Compare the output document in the Viewer pane to  the text in the Rmd file. While you don't have learn all the syntax details at once (I'll introduce them as needed), the pre-populated file does illustrate commonly-needed syntax to:  

- write headings and paragraphs 
- include executable chunks of R code 
- link to a URL 
- mark bold text  
- create a graph 



### including R code 

When we write R code inside an Rmd file, we place it inside special delimiters: 

<pre class="r"><code>```{r}
write some R code
<code>```</code>
</code></pre>

For example, in the pre-populated script you can see two lines of R code in their own chunks, 

<pre class="r"><code>```{r cars}
summary(cars)
<code>```</code>
</code></pre>

and 

<pre class="r"><code>```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
<code>```</code>
</code></pre>

Expressions like `echo=FALSE` are *knitr* options that help control the way the code is evaluated and presented in the output document. 




### output to alternative formats 

If you have MS Word installed on your machine (or Libre/Open Office on Unix-alikes), you can render the Rmd to Word using the Knit pull-down menu.

- ![knit html icon](../resources/images/knit-word-icon.png) 

If you have TeX installed on your machine (MiKTeX on Windows, MacTeX 2013+ on OS X, TeX Live 2013+ on Unix-alikes), you can render the Rmd to PDF 

- ![knit html icon](../resources/images/knit-pdf-icon.png) 

We'll use HTML output for analysis and later switch to Word output for a client report. For now, 

- ![knit html icon](../resources/images/knit-html-icon.png) 




### cleanup  

In the Rmd file, 

- Keep the meta-data header 
- Delete all the rest of the pre-populated text

In the directory, 

- Delete the docx and pdf output files (if any), leaving the directory with: 

```
scripts\
  |-- 009_tidying-wide-data.html 
  `-- 009_tidying-wide-data.Rmd 
```






















<!--
*Save and Knit* anytime you want to see how your changes appear in the output. Remember, this is not a WYSIWYG environment---until you knit it, you won't see it. We could call it WYKIWYS (What You *Knit* Is What You *See*). 









We can dispense with the default prose. In the Rmd file, 

- Delete everything below the YAML header 
- Save and Knit
