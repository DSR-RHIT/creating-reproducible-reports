Our first paragraph establishes the context for the analysis.

- Boxed text and code chunks like those below are meant to be typed---or copied and pasted---into your Rmd script. 
- I'm using a text icon `r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` to indicate text to add to your script
- Save and Knit after each addition to see the result and to ensure your script is error-free. 


`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` The hash tag in `# Introduction` denotes a level-1 heading in the output document.

# Introduction

Calibration test data for an Omega LCL-005 (0--5 lb) load cell (a force sensor) has been provided by the test lab. The goal of this analysis is to determine the calibration equation and estimate the sensor accuracy. 
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` Explain the test setup and import an image.
<pre><code>The lab sent an image of the test setup. A known weight (lb) is attached to the eye hook and the load cell bridge produces an output signal (mV). 

<code>```</code>{r fig.cap = 'Figure 1. Load cell calibration test setup', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/load-cell-setup-786x989px.png")
<code>```</code>
</code></pre>

- The code chunk options `fig.cap` for adding a caption and `out.width` to  scale the size of the image. 
- The R syntax `knitr::include_graphics()` tells R to run the *include_graphics()* function from the *knitr* package
- *include_graphics()* imports the image you downloaded earlier to your `resources` directory. The file path and name are in quotes.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Figure 1. Load cell calibration test setup', out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/load-cell-setup-786x989px.png")
```


# Examine the data 

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` Start a new section.

 I'll use this "Insert a new code chunk" icon `r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-code-chunk-icon.png")`  to tell you to insert a code chunk then write into it the R code that follows.
 
 `r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-code-chunk-icon.png")` Read the data you downloaded and saved in the `data` directory
```{r}
# read the data set as received
library(readr)
data_received <- read_csv('../data/007_wide-data.csv')
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")`
```
First look at the data structure.
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-code-chunk-icon.png")` Display the structure of the R "object" we've named `data_received`. 
```{r}
str(data_received)
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` Comment on the data. Asterisks around a word or phrase are the Rmd syntax for italics.
```
As expected, *read_csv()* produced a data frame. All columns are numerical except the *test_point* column that shows test condition number and a direction. Take a look at the first few rows.
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` New paragraph. 
```
Look at the first few rows of the data set. 
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-code-chunk-icon.png")` The *head()* function displays the first few rows of the data set. 
```{r}
head(data_received)
```


`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` Assess the printout. 
```
The data set has mV readings in several columns, designated *cycle_1*, *cycle_2*, etc. Thus, the data are in wide form and will have to be reshaped to long form for analysis. 

I see some NA values, which is consistent with the calibration test protocol. A summary of the numerical columns might be useful.
```

`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-code-chunk-icon.png")` Summary statistics except for the first column. 
```{r}
# summary-stats except column 1
summary(data_received[ , -1])
```

- *summary()* produces a statistical summary of each column in the data frame. 
- In R, square brackets `[]` subset the data frame. Here the subset `[ , -1]` tells R to keep all rows and omit the first column. 
 
 `r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` Assess the printout.
 
```
For all cycles, the mean, min, and max  readings (mV) are similar. We have NA in the first and last cycles only, as expected.  
```

# Reshape the data to long form

 `r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")` New section. Underscores `_` are privileged characters in Rmd (another way to indicate italics). So to print an underscore in the text we have to "escape" the character by writing `\_`.
 
```
# Reshape the data to long form

For analysis, the data set should be in long form, with every column a  variable and every row a  observation. I've decided on the following  variable names (and what they are): 

- observ (observation number)
- cycle (cycle number)
- test\_pt (test point number and direction)
- input\_lb (applied reference force)
- output\_mV (sensor readings)
```


`r knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/insert-text-icon.png")`
```
The reshaping is all about gathering the data in the *cycle* columns.  I identify which of the column names include *cycle*.
```

```{r}
# indices of cycle columns (listing the mV data)
is_a_cycle_col <- grep('cycle', names(data_received), ignore.case = TRUE)

# the column indices
is_a_cycle_col

# the column names at those locations
colnames(data_received)[is_a_cycle_col]
```

I have the correct output.

To reshape these columns, I create a new column called *cycle* for gathering the existing cycle column-names and a new column called *output_mV* for gathering the associated readings. 

```{r}
library(tidyr)
long_data <- data_received %>%
	gather(cycle, output_mV, is_a_cycle_col) 
print(long_data)
```

Examine the result. 

```{r}
str(long_data)
summary(long_data)
```

The NA entries are superfluous---they are strictly an artifact of the format of the raw data table, having nothing to do with the calibration results. I'll omit all rows with an NA in the *output_mV* column.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
long_data <- long_data %>%
	filter(!output_mV %in% NA)
str(long_data)
```

It's a small enough data set, with `r nrow(long_data)`  observations in `r ncol(long_data)` columns, that I can print the full set. 

```{r}
print(long_data)
```

# Add observation numbers

The test point entries are in the order in which the data were acquired (consistent with the ANSI/ISA standard). So the observation number is the same as the row number.

```{r}
# add a new column
long_data$observ <- 1:nrow(long_data)
head(long_data)
```

# Simplify the cycle number

The *cycle* data are strings, *cycle_1*, *cycle_2*, etc. It might be useful to replace these entries with an integer for the cycle number. 

First, I separate the *cycle* column into two parts using the underscore in the data as the separation pattern. 

```{r}
library(stringr)
split_columns <- str_split_fixed(long_data$cycle, pattern = '_', 2)
```

I keep only the 2nd column (the cycle number), convert it to an integer (it's a character), and assign it as a new column *cycle_no* in the data frame. 

```{r}
long_data$cycle_no <- as.integer(split_columns[ , 2])
head(long_data)
tail(long_data)
```

Spot checking with *head()* and *tail()*, I confirm that the new cycle_no column agrees with the original cycle column data. 


# Final touches

The last steps in tidying this data set are to delete the original  *cycle* column and reuse the name for the new cycle column, to shorten the *test_point* column name, and to rearrange columns in a logical order. 

```{r}
tidy_data <- long_data %>%
	select(-cycle) %>%
	rename('cycle' = cycle_no) %>%
	rename('test_pt' = test_point) %>%
	select(observ, cycle, test_pt, input_lb, output_mV)
print(tidy_data)
```

Write the tidy data to file in the data directory.

```{r}
write_csv(tidy_data, "../data/01_calibr_data-tidying.csv")
```
