## Introduction

Calibrating a *load cell* (a sensor for measuring uniaxial force) yields two main results: a calibration equation relating output voltage (mV) to input force (lb); and an estimate of sensor accuracy as a percentage of full span. In this report, I present the test results for an Omega LCL-005 load cell calibrated following the ANSI/ISA procedure.
