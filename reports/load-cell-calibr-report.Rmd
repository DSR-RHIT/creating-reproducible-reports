# Introduction   

Calibrating a _load cell_ (a sensor for measuring uniaxial force) yields two main results: a calibration equation relating output voltage (mV) to input force (lb); and an estimate of sensor accuracy as a percentage of full span. In this report, I present the test results for an Omega LCL-005 load cell calibrated following the ANSI/ISA procedure.

```{r data_reading}
library(readr)
calibr_data <- read_csv('data/load-cell-calibr-L3.csv')
```

The data are shown in Table 1. Per the ANSI/ISA standard, the test begins and ends at a midspan test point in the same direction, thus the first and last cycle are incomplete (indicated by NA).
