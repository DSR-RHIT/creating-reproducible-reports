## Attributes of reproducible research

<div id="left20">
![](../resources/images/stodden-cover.jpg) 
</div>
<div id="right80">
- Independent scientists compute quantitative results using the original datasets and methods 

- Large data sets, sophisticated models, computation 

- New scientists are generally unprepared to work reproducibly    
</div>




## Attributes of reproducible research

<div id="left20">
![](../resources/images/gandrud-cover.jpg) 
</div>
<div id="right80">
- Data and code used to make a finding are available and sufficient to recreate the finding  

- Data gathering, data analysis, and presentation of results

- Resesarch will be reproduced only if it is easy to reproduce   
</div>



## Initial steps towards reproducibility

<br>

- Everything with a script  
- Organize your data and code  
- Automate the process  
- Turn scripts into reproducible reports  
- Turn repeated code into functions  
- Package functions for reuse  
- Use version control  
- License your software

## Good enough practices 

<br>

- Plan the data management    
- Use readable, reusable, and testable software   
- Aim for simplicity and clarity  to engance collaboration 
- Organize files in a logical and consistent  fashion 
- Use version control  
- Agree on a workflow before starting a manuscript
