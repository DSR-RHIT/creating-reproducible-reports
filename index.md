[\\]: this is an Rmd comment

Welcome! The goal of the workshop is to introduce the R novice to reproducible research in the context of creating a reproducible report using R, RStudio, and knitr.  


### getting started

- [learning objectives](pages/001_learning-objectives.html)
- [pre-workshop homework](pages/002_pre-workshop-hw.html) 
- [workshop agenda](pages/003_workshop-agenda.html) 
- surveying the reproducible research ecosystem 
- considering a sample report 



### tutorials 

- [organizing files](pages/005_organizing-files.html)
- [initializing an Rmd script](pages/006_initializing-a-script.html)
- [tidying the data](pages/006_calibr-data-tidying.html)
- linear regression 
- calibration graph 
- client report 



### next steps 

- what to do when the data change 
- planning for reproducibility 
- starting your own project 
- looking ahead 



### acknowledgments 

Many thanks to many folks in the R community for posting their work in their blogs and repos. I would especially like to thank: 

- [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org) for his  [tutorials](http://kbroman.org/pages/tutorials.html) that made the creation of these GitHub-hosted webpages *almost* painless 
- [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) for her [Stats545 material](http://stat545.com/) and for the
[Good enough practices](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/) paper for guidance on file naming and directory organization.
