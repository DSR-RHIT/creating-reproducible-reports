[\\]: this is an Rmd comment

Welcome! The goal of the workshop is to introduce the R novice to reproducible research in the context of creating a reproducible report using R, RStudio, and knitr.  


### getting started

The pre-workshop homework should take about 30 minutes. 

- [pre-workshop homework](pages/102_pre-workshop-hw.html) 
- [learning objectives](pages/101_learning-objectives.html)

The day of the workshop:  

- [workshop agenda](pages/103_workshop-agenda.html) 
- surveying the reproducible research ecosystem 
- considering a sample report 

### tutorials
