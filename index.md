The workshop introduces reproducible reporting---a component of the  larger reproducible research ecosystem---to the R novice. No prior experience with R or RStudio is required. 

The workshop entails two 3-hour sessions. We focus on these tasks, commonly encountered in technical writing:

- reading, manipulating, and analyzing data 
- creating tables and graphs 
- writing equations and in-line results 
- managing headings, references, and external media 
- organizing your overall workflow for reproducibility
