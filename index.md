Welcome! The goal of the workshop is to introduce the R novice to reproducible research in the context of creating a reproducible report using R, RStudio, and knitr.  



### getting started

- [description and objectives](pages/001_goals.html)
- [pre-workshop homework](pages/002_pre-hw.html) 
- [agenda](pages/003_agenda.html) 
- surveying the reproducible research ecosystem 
- considering a sample report 



### tutorial 

- [creating the file structure](pages/004_create-file-structure.html)
- initializing the Rmd report file 
- adding headings and images 
- read a data file

### acknowledgments 

Many thanks to many folks in the R community for posting their work in their blogs and repos. I would especially like to thank: 

- [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org) for his  [tutorials](http://kbroman.org/pages/tutorials.html) that made the creation of these GitHub-hosted webpages *almost* painless 
- [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) for her [Stats545 material](http://stat545.com/) and for the
[Good enough practices  paper](https://swcarpentry.github.io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/) for helping me think effectively about directory organization.  
- [Reproducible Science  Curriculum](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum) contributors for creating a great collection of teaching materials for reproducible research
