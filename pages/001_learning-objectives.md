### description 

In an interactive environment, we discuss reproducible research, what it is and why we care, followed by a hands-on guided tour of creating a reproducible report. The software tutorials are self-paced; participants moving ahead more quickly should have time apply the principles to work of their own. 

We treat the following aspects of creating a technical document: 

- reading, manipulating, and analyzing data 
- creating tables and graphs 
- writing equations and in-line results 
- managing headings, references, and external media 

### learning objectives 

By the end of the workshop participants should be able to: 

- Describe the problems that reproducibility helps solve 
- Identify non-reproducible practices in their current workflow 
- List the basic principles of reproducible research 
- Organize directories and files for reproducibility 
- Create a reproducible report using R and RStudio
