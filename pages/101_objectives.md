### description 

In an interactive environment, we discuss reproducible research---what it is and why we care---followed by a hands-on guided tour of creating a reproducible analysis and report. 

The software tutorials are self-paced; participants moving ahead more quickly should have time to apply the principles to work of their own. 

We treat the following aspects of creating a technical document reproducibly: 

- Reading, manipulating, and analyzing data 
- Creating tables and graphs 
- Writing equations and in-line results 
- Managing headings, references, and external media 
- Updating all of it when the source data change

###  objectives 

By the end of the workshop participants should be able to: 

- Describe the problems that reproducibility helps solve 
- Identify non-reproducible practices in their current workflow 
- List two basic principles of reproducible research 
- Organize directories and files for reproducibility 
- Create a reproducible report using R and RStudio

### software

The software environments we're using are free. The workshop is designed assuming you have no previous experience with any of these environments. 

- [![RStudio](../resources/images/RStudio-blue-125-small.png)](https://www.rstudio.com/)   RStudio provides an interface for R with tools for project management.

- [![R Markdown](../resources/images/RMarkdownReference.png)](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) R Markdown is a format for writing dynamically reproducible reports with R.

- [![R](../resources/images/Rlogo_small.png)](https://www.r-project.org/) R is a software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
