### tutorial design

You will be writing prose and code in the same document, using R Markdown (Rmd) syntax for prose and R syntax for computing. To help you distinguish between them, I use these icons: 

- `r text_icon` *add text*: prose in Rmd syntax  
- `r code_icon` *add code*: code in R syntax

The two syntaxes will sometimes use the same characters in different ways, for example, the single hash tag (#) in R denotes a comment but in Rmd denotes a level-1 heading. 

### open a new R markdown script 

In your workshop main directory, 

- Launch your project `rr-workshop.Rproj` 
- `File > New File > R Markdown` 
- `Output Format > HTML` 
- `Save As...` to the `scripts/` directory with filename `01_calibr_data-wide.Rmd`  

The Rmd file is pre-populated with prose and some markdown syntax. Here's my first text icon to denote that we are editing the Rmd file. 

`r text_icon` In the Rmd file, edit the YAML header.

### render the script 

You have 3 methods to *Knit* the Rmd file: 

1. *You may* click the button `r knit_html` 
2. *or* use the menu `File` > `Knit Document` 
3. *or* use a keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + K` 

The output should appear in the RStudio Viewer pane. If you compare the pre-populated Rmd file with the rendered output document, you'll see example of commonly-needed syntax to:  

- write headings and paragraphs 
- include executable chunks of R code 
- link to a URL 
- mark bold text  
- create a graph 

We'll see most of these Rmd structures again as we work through the tutorials. 


### output to alternative formats 

If you have MS Word installed on your machine (or Libre/Open Office on Unix-alikes), you can render the Rmd to Word using the Knit pull-down menu. 

- If you have Word installed, `r knit_word`. Did a Word doc open? 

If you have TeX installed on your machine (MiKTeX on Windows, MacTeX 2013+ on OS X, TeX Live 2013+ on Unix-alikes), you can render the Rmd to PDF.

- If you have TeX installed, `r knit_pdf`. Did a PDF doc open? 

However, HTML output renders quickly and we can put off worrying about pagination. 

- For now, we'll use HTML output, `r knit_html`. 


### cleanup  

In the Rmd file, 

- Delete the pre-populated text, leaving only the YAML header
- Save

In the `scripts/` directory, 

- Delete the docx and pdf output files (if any) 

### write your first code chunk

To include lines of R code in our Rmd file, we place them in a *code chunk*. A code chunk opens and closes with 

<pre><code>```{r}

<code>```</code>
</code></pre>

and we write the R code in between. You have 4 methods creating the code chunk delimiters. Choose the one that suits you:

1. *You may* click the ![](../resources/images/insert-code.png) icon 
2. *or* use the menu `Code > Insert Chunk` 
3. *or* use a keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + I` 
4. *or* type the delimiters directly ("back ticks", not single-quotes)

Hereâ€™s my first code icon. Use one of the methods above to create the code chunk delimiters then copy the R code to the code chunk. These lines of R code set a couple of `knitr` options. 

`r code_icon` 

    library(knitr)
    opts_knit$set(root.dir = '../')
    opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE)

Learning R and knitr:

- `library()` is how we load packages to gain access to their functions
- [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is an important R package for reproducibility; it processes the Rmd file (mixture of text and code) and replaces the R code with its output (results or graphs)
- `root.dir = '../'` matches the `knitr` working directory to the RStudio project working directory  
- `echo = TRUE` applies to all subsequent code chunks in the script, printing your R code verbatim to the output document---useful during exploratory computing.
- `collapse = TRUE` keeps code plus code results together in a box in the output document

Edit the code chunk header as follows:

    {r, setup, include = FALSE}

- `setup` is a chunk label. Labels are optional, but if used, must be unique.
- `include = FALSE` suppresses printing for this chunk. The code runs, but results  are not displayed. 

Writing readable code (see [Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) a comprehensive style guide)

- One space on either side of `=`
- No space before a comma, one space after a comma (just like written English) 

Save and `r knit_icon` *knit* the document after every change to check that your script is behaving as you expect. 

### check yourself

Your directories should contain these files:

    data\
      `-- 007_wide-data.csv

    reports\
    
    resources\
      `-- load-cell-setup-786x989px.png 
      
    results\
      
    scripts\
      |-- 01_calibr_data-wide.html
      `-- 01_calibr_data-wide.Rmd
