Prior to the workshop, please download and install R and RStudio. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a user interface for R. 

Install the most recent version of each: R first, then RStudio. 

### Windows

Windows users, you might find that you have to login to your machine as an adminstrator before installing R and RStudio. 

- [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/) from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) -> Install R for the very first time 
- [Download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- [Video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD07NznguA4) for R and RStudio 
- [R installation manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-Windows) for the brave if you need the minutiae 


### Mac OS

- [Download R for (Mac) OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/) from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). 
- [Download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- [Video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywj6yNfc5nM) for R and RStudio  
- [R installation manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-OS-X) for the brave if you need the minutiae 


### Unix-alikes

- [R installation manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-Unix_002dalikes) because you are running a Unix-alike machine. 

### Testing

- Launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to this [screenshot](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). 
- Place your cursor in the *Console* pane. (For MATLAB users, the Console is similar to the MATLAB Command Window.)
- In the Console, type `x <- 4^3` and Enter. In R, assignment operator is `<-`. 
- In the Console, type `x`, and you should see the value  `64` printed to the Console. 





Put your cursor in the pane labelled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like x <- 2 * 4 (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the x object by typing x followed by enter or return. Obviously you should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you are good to go.

Once the software is installed, practice setting up an RStudio project. 

- [Setup an R project](https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/install-R-and-RStudio/blob/master/pages/setup_R_project.md) 

Optional tasks 

- For session 2, bring a report of your own to remake as a reproducible report.
