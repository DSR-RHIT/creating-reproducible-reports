### Getting started

- If you haven't installed R and RStudio, [please do](https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/install-R-and-RStudio/blob/master/pages/install_R.md). 
- If you haven't created an RStudio project and the *.Renviron* file for the workshop, [please do](https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/install-R-and-RStudio/blob/master/pages/setup_R_project.md). 


In your main project directory (I'll call it `workshop` for convenience), create three folders (sub-directories)

- Create a `data` directory
- Create a `reports` directory
- Create a `scripts` directory

Your main directory for the workshop should look like this: 

```
workshop\
  |-- data\
  |-- reports\
  |-- scripts\
  |-- workshop.Rproj
  \-- .Renviron
```

Navigate to my [workshop downloads](https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/creating-reproducible-reports/tree/gh-pages/assets/downloads) folder
